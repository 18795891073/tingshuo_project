What is a death penalty?It is also a capital punishment.It means the executioner use his power which from the law to end a person who can be called a prisoner's life.Nowadays many nations who flaunt ''Benevolence''try to abolish the death penalty.It is really wisdom.
First of all,the death penalty cannot prevent crime from happening in some degree.And it can not maintain the social balance.Criminal law's effect to reduce criminal is limited.And a criminal is not only formed by the maker himself.It has a great relationship with his or her experiences and education. Our society also has a responsibility.If we want to reduce criminal,we should strengthen education and improve the social environment.Should we only look into the offenders'responsibility? Should't our community be blamed?
Nowadays,death penalty has been an international issue.The International human rights organizations announcement every year to condemn China for its overmuch executions.
Next,death penalty can not shock and reduce homicides.Because it often happens between ordinary people.They may not want to kill someone.But a quarrel or some other things create this.The death penalty should be abolished.
At last,everyone has only one life.If an injustice happens,nobody can turn back the clock to give the death a justice.But the injustice often happen.There are many examples that after someone has had an execution while the police find that he is not the murderer.Besides,there are so many people who are forced to admit he is the murderer because they can't bear torture.This is cruel and inhuman.
The death penalty is really a step back.Our not perfect legal system can guarantee there is no injustice.And everyone has a right to survive.The death penalty should be abolished!
